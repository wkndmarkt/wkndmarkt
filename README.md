- 👋 Hi, I’m @wkndmarkt
- 👀 I’m interested in eating, right now
- 🌱 I’m currently learning spanish
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I find interesting
- 📫 How to reach me : if it's winter, go to Casa Morales in Sevilla, Spain, and wait for a few days, I should show up at some time. In summer do the same in Brasserie de Flavigny, Burgundy, France.
